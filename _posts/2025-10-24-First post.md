I created this website with the help of ChatGPT. I found it really engaging to create a website with custom design.　I want to focus on data science and Kaggle until the end of this year. I'm determined to upload blogs about my progress everyday.

★ Three things I want to achieve in 2025:
1．Earn a Kaggle Silver Medal through consistent daily 3-hour practice.
2. Master English — read, write, and speak it effortlessly.
3. Build a powerful body with massive muscles.
